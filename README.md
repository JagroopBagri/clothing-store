## Objectives & Outcomes

The main motivation for this work was to design and deploy a multiple page application using `react-router-domÂ´.

Beyond that, other learning outcomes were:

- Design reusable custom components to be used in multiple places using Styled Components;
- Implement simple yet soothing transition animations between views using the Framer Motion library;
- Further comprehension of state management and state lifting in React;
